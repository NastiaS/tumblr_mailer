      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been a while since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy, enjoying my time there and certainly learn a lot of great things. This is an auto-generated email I leanred how to make in Fullstack Foundations. So I did not manually sent it to you. It was done by all those awesome tools that I am learning how to employ!! It looks like now I know how spamming works! :-) I am not excited about spamming but those engines are just fascinating!

      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Check out my new posts here: 
      
     <ul>
        <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
          <li><a href=<%=latestPosts[i].href %> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a> </li>
        <% } %>
      </ul>
    </p>
